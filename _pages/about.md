I am a 3rd year Chemical Engineering PhD student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Zachary Ulissi](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/bio/). My research focuses on graph neural networks and deep learning applications to catalysis. I strive to develop models and frameworks capable of accelerating atomistic simulations by orders of magnitude while retaining ab-initio level accuracy. Additionally, I explore active learning techniques to tackle similar problems in the small-data regime.

During my PhD, I spent a summer as an intern at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) (2020), working with [Larry Zitnick](https://research.fb.com/people/zitnick-larry/) and [Devi Parikh](https://research.fb.com/people/parikh-devi/) on applying graph neural networks to model atomic interactions.

Prior to grad school, I worked for the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/) as an Environmental Engineer in the Air & Radiation Division. There I was invovled in particulate matter emissions modeling, field inspections, and settlement negotiations. I graduated from [Illinois Tech](https://www.iit.edu/) in 2017 with a Bachelor's and Master's of Advanced Studies in Chemical Engineering.

In my free time I enjoy spending time with family and friends. I am extremely competitive when it comes to sports and board games â€“ my favorites being volleyball and Catan. My wife and I love exploring cities, parks, and new food places.
