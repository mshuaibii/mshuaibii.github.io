## Open Catalyst Project - `ocp`

The development of renewable energy technologies has been limited by the availability of efficient and economical catalysts. To address this, I work closely with collaborators at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) to explore broader catalysis and machine learning applications. We developed the [Open Catalyst Dataset (OC20)](https://opencatalystproject.org/) to enable the development of accurate machine learning models for large-scale atomistic simulations and catalyst screening.

I am a developer of the corresponding codebase, [`ocp`](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp), which includes baseline models, data loaders, evaluators and tools necessary to boot-strap research on the proposed challenges.

## Atomistic Machine Learning Package PyTorch, AMPtorch - `amptorch`

I am the lead developer of [`amptorch`](https://github.com/ulissigroup/amptorch), a machine learning potential package to model atomic interactions using a [Behler-Parinello](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.146401) neural network. The package is built on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric), and [Skorch](https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch) to provide users an easy, flexible, and fast framework to train and iterate new models. 

This project is being developed in collaboration with Brown University's [Andrew Peterson](https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/Peterson/) as part of the Department of Energy's <i>Bridging the time scale in exascale computing of chemical systems</i> project.
